Introduction:-
LibreOffice is a freely available, fully-featured office productivity suite. Its native file format is Open Document Format (ODF), an open standard format that is being adopted by governments world wide as a required file format for publishing and accepting documents.

Development Model:-
LibreOffice follows an open-source development model where a global community of volunteers and organizations collaborates to create and improve the free office software. Anyone can contribute by writing code, fixing bugs, translating, or providing support. The development process is transparent, with regular updates and open discussions, allowing everyone to have a say in the software's direction. This model fosters innovation, ensures accessibility, and results in a powerful, free alternative to commercial office suites like Microsoft Office.

In addition you can read historic details about the process of re-basing LibreOffice onto the Apache licensed based.

Mode of Funding:-
LibreOffice is primarily funded through a combination of sources, including donations, sponsorships, and volunteer contributions. The Document Foundation, which oversees the development of LibreOffice, relies on financial donations from individuals, organizations, and companies to support ongoing development, infrastructure maintenance, and community activities. Additionally, some commercial entities that utilize LibreOffice or offer related services may provide sponsorship or resources to support the project. Furthermore, a significant portion of the work on LibreOffice is carried out by volunteers who contribute their time and expertise to the project. This diverse funding model helps ensure the continued growth and availability of LibreOffice as a free and open-source office productivity suite.
